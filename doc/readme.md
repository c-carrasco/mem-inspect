MemInspect Library
==================

**Welcome to the MemInspect Library**, a versatile C++, header-only librar designed for memory tracking and leak detection.
This library provides a hassle-free experience and is designed to be a simple and valuable complement to more powerful and complex solution like Valgrind, especially in scenarios where such tools are unavailable or impractical, such as embedded platforms.

# Quick Start Guide

### 1. Include the `memory_tracker.h` header.

```CPP
#include <meminspect/memory_tracker.h>
```

**Note:** All functions, classes, structures, enums, ...  reside within the `meminspect` namespace.
